# what is this
this is a simple java cli program to generate passwords based on a "magical touch" of the user's

# usage
### what is the magical touch (mt)?
this is the `String` that will be add to the beginning of all your passwords. it is only added once (unless you wanna edit it from the .txt file that will be created in the directory) and at the first run of the program.

### how to use it?
even though there are usage instructions as you run the code, but here, i'm nice and i'll help ya :D
1. you will be asked to input the name (or the shortcut of the name) of the website or app you are generating a password for,
2. then, you will input your fav number, char, or whatever you wanna add

   yep, that's basically it. the rest is done by the program ;)

have a nice day!
